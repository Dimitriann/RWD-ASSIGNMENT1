        <td class="description"><b>Body Fit</b> is strength training in the team room. For Body Fit, you will work with heavy weight and get repetitions that you know from the classic strength training. Our instructors organize the hour so that you can train all the major muscle groups and get the maximum benefit from your workout. At a Body Fit hour you build strength and become stronger. The technique for all the exercises will be explained thoroughly and the instructor will help you correct your technique along the way. In Body Fit, the primary tools are barbs with washers and dumbbells. You adjust yourself to how heavy your barbell should be and you can therefore adjust the level to suit you. The hour is for those who want to exercise, but at the same time keep training in the team room and would like to be motivated by our skilled instructors. </td>
